## User Stories

## Design
 ### Colour
 The colour on the website is based around the hero images, which are the Ferrari cars #D40000. I then chose colours that complimented this colour and were neutral so it made the red stand out and be eye catching. 

 ### Font
 Hind is used for the headings and Montserrat is used for the main text. Sans-serif is used as the backup text. These fonts were chosen to give the website a simple but modern look. 

## Wireframes 
 The wireframes for the websites can be found below. I decided not to put text above the social media links in the footer as I preferred the look without text. I also put text on in hero image in the center instead of to the right and moved the logo to the right and menu to the left as I also preferred how this looked.
