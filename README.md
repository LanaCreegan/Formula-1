## Design
 ### Colour
 The colour on the website is based around the hero images, which are the Ferrari cars #D40000. I then chose colours that complimented this colour and were neutral so it made the red stand out and be eye catching. 

 ### Font
 Hind is used for the headings and Montserrat is used for the main text. Sans-serif is used as the backup text. These fonts were chosen to give the website a simple but modern look.
