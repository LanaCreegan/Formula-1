                    <p>The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing of
                        the 1920s and 1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must
                        meet. Formula One was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 with the first non-championship
                        races taking place that year.
                        The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing
                        organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before World War II, but due to the
                        suspension of racing during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship did not become
                        formalised until 1947. The first world championship race took place at Silverstone in the United
                        Kingdom in 1950. </p>

                    <p>During the 2000s, Formula One cars had become complex, efficient, and reliable, so much that
                        actual racing between drivers began to become less common. 2009 saw the introduction of new
                        rules and regulations (including engine RPM limits, an adjustable front wing, and
                        disproportionate wing sizes) encouraging overtaking.
                        In 2011, other changes included a re-introduction KERS, the introduction of the Drag reduction
                        system (DRS) (a moveable flap on the cars rear wing), a change in tyre supplier to Pirelli, and
                        a ban on team orders. Red Bull dominated from 2010 to 2013, with Sebastian Vettel winning four
                        Driver's Championships.

                    <p>Formula One entered its second turbocharged era in 2014. The series is being run under the most
                        radical engine regulation changes since 1995. All cars entering a Formula One championship race
                        must run with 1.6-litre single turbocharged 6-cylinder engines.
                        Since 2017, new rules about aerodynamics and the improvement of the engines, reaching around
                        1000 hp, have made the cars faster than the 2004 ones, breaking numerous track records. Mercedes
                        and their drivers, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg dominated the start of the hybrid era, the
                        success being Mercedes' development of the split turbocharger, giving Mercedes advantage due to
                        the need for less cooling and a more compact power unit.
                        This domanance came to an end in 2021 when Red Bull's Max Verstappen won the Driver's
                        Championship.
